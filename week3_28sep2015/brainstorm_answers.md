Chem-Seq is a method to investigate small molecule/DNA interaction. It is used to gain insights of how a small molecule (chem. compound) influences cellular functions, for example, it could reveal the action mechanism of a DNA associated (influencing replication, transcription, etc.) drug.
The method is similar to ChIP-seq, which measures DNA/protein interactions, but instead of antibodies, chemical compounds are used. 

*(technology -> application -> statistics)*

**Chem-Seq -> small molecule/DNA interactions -> Poisson / Negative Binomial (NB) or zero-inflated NB**

Metagenomics is a method where all the DNA of a particular environment is sequenced. In comparative metagenomics, the goal is to identify features (taxa or biological pathway) which are more abundant in one populations of samples (for example, healthy individual) compared to another population of samples (for example, sick individuals).

PD-Seq is a method that allow to understand protein-protein interaction. Phage display has been used to study protein-DNA, protein-protein and protein-peptide interactions. This technic combined with deep sequencing allows the analysis of high complex different interactions.

In order to monitor global transcriptional activity, run-on technology was coupled to RNAseq. This technique allowed to generalise the phenomenon of stalled polymerases at the transcriptional start site (TSS) as well as their widespread bidirectional activity.

**GRO-Seq-> transcriptional activity, eg. comparing activity at the TSS to gene body  ->  Fisher's exact**

CNV-seq is a method to detect CNV (DNA copy number variation) by shotgun sequencing, conceptually derived from aCGH (microarray-based procedure).
Instead of a microarray, CNV-seq uses two sets of shotgun reads, one from each target individual, which are mapped by sequence alignment on a template genome. A sliding window approach is used to analyze the mapped regions and CNVs are detected by computing the number of reads for each individual in each of the windows, yielding ratios, which are later assessed by the computation of a probability of a random occurrence, given no copy number variation. 

*(technology -> application -> statistics)* 

**CNV-seq-> DNA copy number variation ->  Poisson, standard Gaussian distribution**

PARS-Seq (Parallel Analysis of RNA Sequence) is a method where RNA folding stability is measured across the transcriptome.  Genome-wide structural dynamics of RNA can parse functional elements of the transcriptome and reveal diverse biological insights.

Pas-Seq (Poly A Site Sequencing) is a sequencing method for identifying Alternative polyadenylation (APA). APA is a universal post transcriptional gene regulation method, which results in a gene to code several RNAs through multiple mechanisms, such as producing mRNAs that code for different proteins isoforms that have various physiological properties, Thus, like alternative splicing. Also, APA produces mRNAs with different 3' UTR end, which directly affect the microRNA activity and interaction with the mRNA.

Reference: Andrew M. Smith et al., “Quantitative Phenotyping via Deep Barcode Sequencing,” Genome Research (July 21, 2009), doi:10.1101/gr.093955.109.

Barcode Analysis by Sequencing (Bar-Seq) directly compares data obtained from a barcode microarray-based chemogenomic assay, estimating which genes are (un)expressed in a given microarray hybridization, to that of high-throughput sequencing. The method thereby allows for quantitative characterization of complex (strain-)pools, identification of gene–environment interactions on a genome-wide scale, and of drug targets.

The Affymetrix SNP Array 6.0 consists out of 1.8 million genetic markers on a single chip (>900k single nucleotide polymorphisms and >900k probes for the detection of the copy number). It is used to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (changes of single nucleotides in the DNA) in the human genome. These SNPs are being assiotiated with different diseases like cancer, CNS disorders, Cardiovascular or other disorders.
